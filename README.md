# Summary
This application automates the testing of `execute.py` and processes data from `data.csv`. It ensures that the code runs correctly and meets all acceptance criteria specified in the task.

# Setup
To view this application on GitHub Pages, navigate to the following URL: [GitHub Pages URL](https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/). To run locally, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

# Usage
The application fetches data from `data.csv` and calculates the total sales. The result is displayed on the page. No URL parameters are required.

# Files
- `index.html`: Main application file that displays total sales.
- `README.md`: This documentation.
- `LICENSE`: MIT license.
- `data.csv`: Converted data from `data.xlsx` for processing.
- `execute.py`: Python script that processes data.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions configuration for CI/CD.

# Testing
The following acceptance criteria are implemented:
1. `execute.py`, `data.csv`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exist.
2. `result.json` is NOT committed.
3. `execute.py` does not contain the typo "revenew".
4. `data.csv` content equals `data.xlsx` (attachment).
5. CI YAML has steps for ruff, executing `execute.py`, and Pages deploy.
6. GitHub Actions ran for this commit and logs show ruff + `execute.py`.
7. `result.json` is published on GitHub Pages.

Each of these checks is validated through the application logic and CI/CD pipeline.
